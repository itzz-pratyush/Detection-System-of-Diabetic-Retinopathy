## Introduction

Welcome to the Detection System of Diabetic Retinopathy project README! This document provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to get started, and guidelines for contributing.

Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss or blindness in people with diabetes. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to develop a computer-based detection system that can assist in the early identification of diabetic retinopathy by analyzing retinal images.

## Project Overview

The Detection System of Diabetic Retinopathy is a machine learning-based application that utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze retinal images and detect signs of diabetic retinopathy. The system offers the following features:

- **Image Input**: Accepts digital retinal images as input, either from medical imaging equipment or uploaded images.

- **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection**: Utilizes deep learning models and image processing algorithms to analyze retinal images and classify them into different stages of diabetic retinopathy.

- **Reporting and Visualization**: Generates reports and visualizations that provide information about the detected retinopathy stages, including the severity of the condition.

- **User Interface**: Includes a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, uploading images, and viewing results.

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large volume of retinal images efficiently and accurately.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python packages (specified in the `requirements.txt` file) installed. You can install them using `pip`:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- A dataset of retinal images for training and testing the system (not provided with this project).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetic-retinopathy-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd diabetic-retinopathy-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

4. Set up your dataset. Ensure you have a dataset of retinal images for training and testing the system. Organize the data appropriately and configure the data paths in the project's configuration files.

5. Train the model if necessary and configure the model settings in the project.

## Usage

1. Start the system by running the main application script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the provided user interface or API endpoints to upload retinal images for analysis.

3. The system will process the images and provide reports on the detected diabetic retinopathy stages.

4. Review the results and take appropriate actions based on the severity of the condition.
